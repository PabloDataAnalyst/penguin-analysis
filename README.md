# Penguin Species Analysis üêß

## Goal:
Understand how **penguin size** and **physical traits** differ across **species** and **islands** to identify which **environments favor larger or smaller penguins**.
This analysis could help **biologists or environmental researchers** study how habitat and adaptation influence penguin morphology.

## Process:
1. Cleaned and grouped the data by species and island.
2. Calculated average bill length and body mass.
3. Built a dashboard combining four visual comparisons.

## Tools:
R, ggplot2, dplyr, patchwork  

**Dataset:** Palmer Penguins  
**Focus:** Data cleaning, grouping, and visualization

## Results:
The analysis shows clear differences in size patterns among penguin species and islands, likely driven by habitat and evolutionary adaptation.

### Insights
- Gentoo penguins tend to be the largest and have longer bills, suggesting adaptation to deeper foraging habitats.
