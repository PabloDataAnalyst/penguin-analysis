# Penguin Species Analysis üêß

## Goal:
Understand how **penguin size** and **physical traits** differ across **species** and **islands** to identify which **environments favor larger or smaller penguins**.
This analysis could help **biologists or environmental researchers** study how habitat and adaptation influence penguin morphology.

## Process:
1. Cleaned and grouped the data by species and island.
2. Calculated average bill length and body mass.
3. Built a dashboard combining four visual comparisons.

## Tools:
R, ggplot2, dplyr, patchwork  

**Dataset:** Palmer Penguins  
**Focus:** Data cleaning, grouping, and visualization

## Results:
The analysis shows clear differences in size patterns among penguin species and islands, likely driven by habitat and evolutionary adaptation.

### Insights
- Gentoo penguins tend to be the largest with longer bills, suggesting adaptation to deeper foraging habitats.
- Some islands consistently have larger or smaller penguins within the same species, indicating differences in food resources or environmental conditions.
- Body size and bill length are likely related to the type of prey available on each island, useful for ecological studies.
- Morphological differences between species and islands suggest evolutionary adaptation to local conditions (climate, predators, food availability).
- These patterns can serve as a reference for conserving critical habitats, especially on islands where limited resources may impact the survival of larger species.
